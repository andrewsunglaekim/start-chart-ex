# Start Chart JS exercise

In this exercise we'll be building the basic building blocks of our very own charting library.

We are given an object oriented solution to a scatter plot chart.

We've been tasked to create an object oriented solution for a bar chart.

## Rules

- no external dependencies all html, css or vanilla js
- try to use OOJS(object oriented javascript)

## Starter and Solution code

The starter code is located in the `bar-chart-starter` branch

- a solution is provided in the `bar-chart-solution` branch

> A note about solution code. In coding there are always many solutions to a problem. This case is no different. This solution doesn't presume to be the best solution, but it's a decent one. The solution is also there so that people can view it if they get stuck in any way.

## Getting started

- Use the same data provided for the scatter plot chart, to generate the bar chart.
- Start by creating a `BarChart` Class similar to the ScatterPlot Chart.
